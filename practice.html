    <p>My name is Ji.I consider my strengths lie in having high potential to contribute to creating future opportunities, great problem-solving skills and clear communication skills because I have faced and overcame various challenges which allow me to continuously learn and grow. Due to the personal circumstances of my family environment, I grew up in an environment where I had to rely solely on myself. However, I hold on to the fact that such a family environment cannot be changed at all by myself, and I have continued to focus on what I can do in "the present" rather than blaming my circumstance for what things I have failed or could not do. Some people may see this situation as unfortunate and simply accept this reality and does not seek to improve. I, on the other hand, has turned it as opportunities. I believe that this became my fuel for strength and perseverance and helped me to never give up on what I want to do until the moment I achieve it. Consequently, I was able to enter Ritsumeikan University and challenge the new life in Australia and Canada, where there is no one I can rely on, for the purpose of studying English and earning money for me to afford school and living costs in the UK, where I am finally studying. Even though this took me many years of my time, I strongly believe that this was the reason I achieved to continuously improve myself. In the process, I was lucky enough to meet a lot of people from different nationalities and made me understand that the small place I was living in. Despite facing countless problems in understanding the difference between the people with different nationalities, I can now understand and accept the difference between us, and these experiences have given me the confidence to communicate with them better. In addition, I faced countless problems in the process. This experience, however, gave me the ability to avoid future problems that could potentially arise and to discover the ways to resolve problems efficiently and quickly if they do arise. Some people may consider all these experiences "wasteful", but I am convinced that this experience has made who I am today.</p>
